# Task ID: 2
# Title: Layout Shell Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the global layout shell with Left Sidebar, Top Bar, Right AI Drawer, Content area, and Sticky Action Bar components.
# Details:
1. Create a main Layout component that wraps all pages
2. Implement Left Sidebar with collapsible sections that change by role
3. Build Top Bar with logo, global search, notifications bell, Theme Switch, and user menu
4. Create Command-K modal for quick actions
5. Implement Right AI Insights Drawer with toggle functionality
6. Set up Content area with 12-column responsive grid
7. Add Sticky Action Bar for primary CTAs
8. Implement responsive behavior for all layout components

Example layout structure:
```tsx
// src/components/Layout.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Sidebar } from './Sidebar';
import { TopBar } from './TopBar';
import { AIDrawer } from './AIDrawer';
import { ActionBar } from './ActionBar';

export function Layout() {
  const [sidebarCollapsed, setSidebarCollapsed] = useState(false);
  const [aiDrawerOpen, setAIDrawerOpen] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen overflow-hidden">
      <Sidebar collapsed={sidebarCollapsed} onToggle={() => setSidebarCollapsed(!sidebarCollapsed)} />
      
      <div className="flex flex-col flex-1 overflow-hidden">
        <TopBar onAIToggle={() => setAIDrawerOpen(!aiDrawerOpen)} />
        
        <div className="flex flex-1 overflow-hidden">
          <main className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto p-6">
            <div className="grid grid-cols-12 gap-6">
              <Outlet />
            </div>
          </main>
          
          {aiDrawerOpen && <AIDrawer />}
        </div>
        
        <ActionBar />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
2. Verify that sidebar collapses and expands correctly
3. Ensure AI Drawer toggles properly
4. Test Command-K modal opens with keyboard shortcut
5. Validate that all layout components render correctly in different themes
6. Check accessibility for keyboard navigation and screen readers

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Main Layout Component Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the base Layout component that will serve as the shell for all pages, including the basic structure for sidebar, topbar, content area, and action bar.
### Details:
Create src/components/Layout.tsx with the basic structure shown in the example. Implement useState hooks for sidebar collapse and AI drawer toggle states. Use flex layout for the main container and ensure proper nesting of components. Set up the Outlet from react-router-dom to render page content.

## 2. Implement Left Sidebar Component [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create a collapsible sidebar component with navigation sections that adapt based on user role.
### Details:
Create src/components/Sidebar.tsx with collapsible functionality. Implement navigation sections with icons and labels. Add role-based conditional rendering for different menu items. Include toggle button for collapse/expand. Use CSS transitions for smooth collapse/expand animations. Implement active state styling for current route.
<info added on 2025-08-21T10:54:10.305Z>
Task 2.2 has been completed successfully with the following enhancements to the Sidebar component:

The sidebar now features a desktop collapse/expand toggle button with smooth width transitions between 16px (collapsed) and 64px (expanded) states. Navigation items highlight based on the current route using useLocation, and the collapsed state displays an icons-only view with tooltips for accessibility. 

All navigation items have proper path handling and click handlers. The quick action button displays role-specific labels (New Referral, Upload Report, New Case, etc.). CSS transitions have been improved for width changes and mobile overlay animations.

Accessibility has been enhanced with ARIA labels and tooltips for the collapsed state. The component maintains mobile overlay functionality while adding desktop collapse capability.

Key additions include a desktop collapse toggle button with ChevronLeft/ChevronRight icons, collapsed state with icons-only view, route-aware active states, role-specific quick action labels, an expand button for collapsed state, tooltips for collapsed elements, and smooth width transitions.
